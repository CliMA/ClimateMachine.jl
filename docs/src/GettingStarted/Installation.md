# Installing ClimateMachine

## Install Julia

The Climate Machine (CLIMA) uses the Julia programming language and has been tested for the latest Julia release version 1.4, which can be downloaded via your package manager or from the [Julia website](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release).

## Install MPI (optional)

The `ClimateMachine` uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for
distributed processing via the
[MPI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl) package. This package
downloads and installs an MPI implementation for your platform. However, on
high-performance computing systems, you will probably want to configure this
package to use the system-provided MPI implementation. You can do so by setting
the environment variable `JULIA_MPI_BINARY=system`.

Install `MPI.jl` in Julia using the built-in package manager (press `]` at
the Julia prompt):

```julia
julia> ]
(v1.4) pkg> add MPI
```

The package should be installed and built without errors. You can verify
that all is well with:

```julia
julia> ]
(v1.4) pkg> test MPI
```

If you are having problems, see the [`MPI.jl`
documentation](https://juliaparallel.github.io/MPI.jl/stable/configuration/)
for help.

## Install the `ClimateMachine`

Download the `ClimateMachine`
[source](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl) (you will need
[`Git`](https://git-scm.com/)):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl
```

Now change into the `ClimateMachine.jl` directory and install all the packages
required with:

```
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; pkg"instantiate"; pkg"build MPI"'
```

Pre-compile the packages to allow the `ClimateMachine` to start faster:

```
$ julia --project -e 'using Pkg; pkg"precompile"'
```

You can verify your installation with:

```
$ julia --project test/runtests.jl
```

This will take a while!

You are now ready to run one of the tutorials. For instance, the dry
Rayleigh Benard tutorial:

```
$ julia --project tutorials/Atmos/dry_rayleigh_benard.jl
```

The `ClimateMachine` is CUDA-enabled and will use GPU(s) if available. To run
on the CPU, set the environment variable `CLIMATEMACHINE_GPU` to `false`.
