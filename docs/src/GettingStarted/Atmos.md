# Atmosphere model configurations

The struct `AtmosModel` defines a specific subtype of a balance law
(i.e. conservation equations) specific to atmospheric modeling. A
complete description of a `model` is provided by the fields listed
below. In this implementation of the `AtmosModel` we concern ourselves
with the conservative form of the compressible equations of moist fluid
motion given a set of initial, boundary and forcing(source) conditions.

First, we construct the atmospheric physics via `AtmosPhysics`:

```
physics = AtmosPhysics{FT}(;
    param_set::AbstractParameterSet;
    ref_state = HydrostaticState(DecayingTemperatureProfile{FT}(param_set),)
    turbulence = SmagorinskyLilly{FT}(0.21),
    hyperdiffusion = NoHyperDiffusion(),
    moisture = EquilMoist(),
    precipitation = NoPrecipitation(),
    radiation = NoRadiation(),
    tracers = NoTracers(),
)
```

### LES Configuration (with defaults)
Default field values for the LES `AtmosModel` definition are included
below. Users are directed to the model subcomponent pages to view the
possible options for each subcomponent.
```
atmos = AtmosModel{FT}(
    ::Type{AtmosLESConfigType},
    physics::AtmosPhysics;
    orientation = FlatOrientation(),
    source = (Gravity(), Coriolis(), GeostrophicForcing{FT}(7.62e-5, 0, 0)),
    problem = AtmosBC(physics),
    init_state_prognostic = nothing,
    data_config = nothing,
)
```

!!! note

    Most AtmosModel subcomponents are common to both LES / GCM
    configurations.  Equation sets are written in vector-invariant form and
    solved in Cartesian coordinates.  The component `orientation` determines
    whether the problem is solved in a `box (LES)` or a `sphere (GCM)`)


### GCM Configuration (with defaults)
Default field values for the GCM `AtmosModel` definition are included
below. Users are directed to the model subcomponent pages to view the
possible options for each subcomponent.

```
    ::Type{AtmosGCMConfigType},
    physics::AtmosPhysics;
    source::S = (Gravity(), Coriolis()),
    boundarycondition::BC = AtmosBC(physics),
    init_state_prognostic::IS = nothing,
    data_config::DC = nothing,
```
