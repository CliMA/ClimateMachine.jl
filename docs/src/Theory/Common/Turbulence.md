## [Turbulence Closures](@id Turbulence-Closures-docs)
Module `TurbulenceClosures.jl` currently supports 
pointwise models of the eddy viscosity/eddy diffusivity type.

Supported constructors include are:\
[`ConstantViscosityWithDivergence`](@ref constant-viscosity)\
[`SmagorinskyLilly`](@ref smagorinsky-lilly)\
[`Vreman`](@ref vreman)\
[`AnisoMinDiss`](@ref aniso-min-diss)\

!!! note
    Usage: This is a quick-ref guide to using turbulence models as a
    subcomponent of `AtmosModel` \
    $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, $C_smag$ is the Smagorinsky Model coefficient,
    - `turbulence=ConstantViscosityWithDivergence(ν)`\
    - `turbulence=SmagorinskyLilly(C_smag)`\
    - `turbulence=Vreman(C_smag)`\
    - `turbulence=AnisoMinDiss(C_poincare)`

```julia
using DocStringExtensions
using CLIMAParameters.Atmos.SubgridScale: inv_Pr_turb
export ConstantViscosityWithDivergence, SmagorinskyLilly, Vreman, AnisoMinDiss
export turbulence_tensors
```

## Abstract Type
We define a `TurbulenceClosure` abstract type and default functions for the
generic turbulence closure which will be overloaded with model specific
functions. Minimally, overloaded functions for the following stubs must
be defined for a turbulence model.

```julia
abstract type TurbulenceClosure end


vars_state(::TurbulenceClosure, ::AbstractStateType, FT) = @vars()

function atmos_init_aux!(
    ::TurbulenceClosure,
    ::AtmosModel,
    aux::Vars,
    geom::LocalGeometry,
) end
function compute_gradient_argument!(
    ::TurbulenceClosure,
    transform::Vars,
    state::Vars,
    aux::Vars,
    t::Real,
) end
function compute_gradient_flux!(
    ::TurbulenceClosure,
    ::Orientation,
    diffusive,
    ∇transform,
    state,
    aux,
    t,
) end
```

The following may need to be addressed if turbulence models require
additional state variables or auxiliary variable updates (e.g. TKE based
models)

```julia
vars_state(::TurbulenceClosure, ::Prognostic, FT) = @vars()
function atmos_nodal_update_auxiliary_state!(
    ::TurbulenceClosure,
    ::AtmosModel,
    state::Vars,
    aux::Vars,
    t::Real,
) end
```

## Eddy-viscosity Models
The following function provides an example of a stub for an eddy-viscosity
model.  Currently, scalar and diagonal tensor viscosities and diffusivities
are supported.

Generic math functions for use within the turbulence closures such as
the [principal tensor invariants](@ref tensor-invariants), [symmetric
tensors](@ref symmetric-tensors) and [tensor norms](@ref tensor-norms)
have been included.

### [Pricipal Invariants](@id tensor-invariants)
```math
\textit{I}_{1} = \mathrm{tr(X)} \\
\textit{I}_{2} = (\mathrm{tr(X)}^2 - \mathrm{tr(X)^2}) / 2 \\
\textit{I}_{3} = \mathrm{det(X)} \\
```

### [Symmetrize](@id symmetric-tensors)
```math
\frac{\mathrm{X} + \mathrm{X}^{T}}{2} \\
```
### [2-Norm](@id tensor-norms)
Given a tensor X, return the tensor dot product
```math
\sum_{i,j} S_{ij}^2
```
### [Strain-rate Magnitude](@id strain-rate-magnitude)
By definition, the strain-rate magnitude, as defined in standard turbulence
modelling is computed such that

```math
|\mathrm{S}| = \sqrt{2 \sum_{i,j} \mathrm{S}_{ij}^2}
```
where
```math
\vec{S}(\vec{u}) = \frac{1}{2}  \left(\nabla\vec{u} +  \left( \nabla\vec{u} \right)^T \right)
```
\mathrm{S} is the rate-of-strain tensor. (Symmetric component of the
velocity gradient). Note that the skew symmetric component (rate-of-rotation)
is not currently computed.

```julia
"""
    strain_rate_magnitude(S)
Given the rate-of-strain tensor `S`, computes its magnitude.
"""
function strain_rate_magnitude(S::SHermitianCompact{3, FT, 6}) where {FT}
    return sqrt(2 * norm2(S))
end
```

### [Constant Viscosity Model](@id constant-viscosity)
`ConstantViscosityWithDivergence` requires a user to specify the constant
viscosity (kinematic) and appropriately computes the turbulent stress
tensor based on this term. Diffusivity can be computed using the turbulent
Prandtl number for the appropriate problem regime.

```math
\tau = - 2 \nu \mathrm{S}
```

## [Smagorinsky-Lilly](@id smagorinsky-lilly)
The Smagorinsky turbulence model, with Lilly's correction to
stratified atmospheric flows, is included in ClimateMachine.
The input parameter to this model is the Smagorinsky coefficient.
For atmospheric flows, the coefficient `C_smag` typically takes values between
0.15 and 0.23. Flow dependent `C_smag` are currently not supported (e.g. Germano's
extension). The Smagorinsky-Lilly model does not contain explicit filtered terms.

#### Equations

```math
\nu = (C_{s} \mathrm{f}_{b} \Delta)^2 \sqrt{|\mathrm{S}|}
```
with the stratification correction term
```math
f_{b} =
   \begin{cases}
   1 & \mathrm{Ri} \leq 0 ,\\
   \max(0, 1 - \mathrm{Ri} / \mathrm{Pr}_{t})^{1/4} & \mathrm{Ri} > 0 .
   \end{cases}
```
```math
\mathrm{Ri} =  \frac{N^2}{{|S|}^2}
```
```math
N = \left( \frac{g}{\theta_v} \frac{\partial \theta_v}{\partial z}\right)^{1/2}
```
Here, $\mathrm{Ri}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}_{t}$ are the Richardson and turbulent
Prandtl numbers respectively.  $\Delta$ is the mixing length in the relevant
coordinate direction. We use the DG metric terms to determine the local
effective resolution (see `src/Mesh/Geometry.jl`), and modify the vertical
lengthscale by the stratification correction factor $\mathrm{f}_{b}$
so that $\Delta_{vert} = \Delta z f_b$.

## [Vreman Model](@id vreman)
Vreman's turbulence model for anisotropic flows, which provides a less
dissipative solution (specifically in the near-wall and transitional regions)
than the Smagorinsky-Lilly method. This model relies of first derivatives
of the velocity vector (i.e., the gradient tensor).  By design, the Vreman
model handles transitional as well as fully turbulent flows adequately.
The input parameter to this model is the Smagorinsky coefficient -
the coefficient is modified within the model functions to account for
differences in model construction.

#### Equations
```math
\nu_{t} = 2.5 C_{s}^2 \sqrt{\frac{B_{\beta}}{u_{i,j}u_{i,j}}},
```
where ($i,j, m = (1,2,3)$)
```math
\begin{align}
B_{\beta} &= \beta_{11}\beta_{22} + \beta_{11}\beta_{33} + \beta_{22}\beta_{33} - (\beta_{13}^2 + \beta_{12}^2 + \beta_{23}^2) \\
\beta_{ij} &= \Delta_{m}^2 u_{i, m} u_{j, m} \\
u_{i,j} &= \frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}.
\end{align}
```

## [Anisotropic Minimum Dissipation](@id aniso-min-diss)
This method is based Vreugdenhil and Taylor's minimum-dissipation
eddy-viscosity model.  The principles of the Rayleigh quotient minimizer
are applied to the energy dissipation terms in the conservation equations,
resulting in a maximum dissipation bound, and a model for eddy viscosity
and eddy diffusivity.

```math
\nu_e = (\mathrm{C}\delta)^2  \mathrm{max}\left[0, - \frac{\hat{\partial}_k \hat{u}_{i} \hat{\partial}_k \hat{u}_{j} \mathrm{\hat{S}}_{ij}}{\hat{\partial}_p \hat{u}_{q} \hat{\partial}_p \hat{u}_{q}} \right]
```
