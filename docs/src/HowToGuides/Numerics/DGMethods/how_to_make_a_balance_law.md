# How to make a Balance law

```@meta
CurrentModule = ClimateMachine.DGMethods
```

Defining the set of solved PDEs in ClimateMachine revolve around defining a
[`BalanceLaw`](@ref DGMethods.BalanceLaw). A balance law solves equations of the form:

```
∂Y
-- = - ∇ • ( F_{first_order}(Y) + F_{second_order}(Y, Σ) ) + S_{non_conservative}(Y, Σ)
∂t
```

Here, `Y`, `Σ`, `F_{first_order}`, `F_{second_order}`, and
`S_{non_conservative}` can be thought of column vectors[^1] expressing:

 - `Y` the conservative state variables, or unknowns of the PDEs to be solved

 - `Σ` the gradients of functions of the conservative state variables

 - `F_{first-order}` contains all first-order fluxes (e.g. **not** functions
 of gradients of any variables)

 - `F_{second-order}` contains all second-order and higher-order fluxes
 (e.g. functions of gradients of any variables)

 - `S_{non_conservative}` non-conservative sources[^2]

In order to alleviate users from being concerned with the burden of
spatial discretization, users must provide their own implementations of
the following methods, which are computed locally at each nodal point:

## Variable name specification methods
| **Method** | Necessary | Purpose |
|:-----|:---|:----|
| [`vars_state_conservative`](@ref DGMethods.vars_state_conservative)         | **YES** |  specify the names of the variables in the conservative state vector, typically mass, momentum, and various tracers. |
| [`vars_state_auxiliary`](@ref DGMethods.vars_state_auxiliary)           | **YES** |  specify the names of any variables required for the balance law that aren't related to derivatives of the state variables (e.g. spatial coordinates or various integrals) or those needed to solve expensive auxiliary equations (e.g., temperature via a non-linear equation solve)     |
| [`vars_state_gradient`](@ref DGMethods.vars_state_gradient)         | **YES** |  specify the names of the gradients of functions of the conservative state variables. used to represent values before **and** after differentiation |
| [`vars_state_gradient_flux`](@ref DGMethods.vars_state_gradient_flux)         | **YES** |  specify the names of the gradient fluxes necessary to impose Neumann boundary conditions. typically the product of a diffusivity tensor with a gradient state variable, potentially equivalent to the second-order flux for a conservative state variable |
| [`vars_integrals`](@ref DGMethods.vars_integrals)         | **NO** |  specify the names of any one-dimensional vertical integrals from **bottom to top** of the domain required for the balance law. used to represent both the integrand **and** the resulting indefinite integral |
| [`vars_reverse_integrals`](@ref DGMethods.vars_reverse_integrals)         | **NO** |  specify the names of any one-dimensional vertical integral from **top to bottom** of the domain required for the balance law. each variable here must also exist in `vars_integrals` since the reverse integral kernels use subtraction to reverse the integral instead of performing a new integral. use to represent the value before **and** after reversing direction |

## Methods to compute fluxes and sources
| **Method** | Purpose |

## Methods to set initial conditions

| [`init_state_auxiliary!`](@ref DGMethods.init_state_auxiliary!) | provide initial values for the auxiliary variables as a function of the geometry. |


## General Remarks

While `Y` can be thought of a column vector (each _row_ of which corresponds
to each state variable and its prognostic equation), the _second_ function
argument inside these methods behave as dictionaries, for example:

```julia
struct MyModel <: BalanceLaw end

function vars_state_conservative(m::MyModel, FT)
    @vars begin
        ρ::FT
        T::FT
    end
end

function source!(m::MyModel, source::Vars, args...)
    source.ρ = 1 # adds a source of 1 to RHS of ρ equation
    source.T = 1 # adds a source of 1 to RHS of T equation
end
```

All equations are marched simultaneously in time.

as this can leak conservation of the unknowns and lead to numerical
instabilities. It is recommended to use either `F_{diffusive}` or
`F_{non_diffusive}`, as these fluxes are communicated across elements[^3]
