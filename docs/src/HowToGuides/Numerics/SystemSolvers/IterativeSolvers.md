# Contribution Guide for Abstract Iterative Solvers

```@meta
CurrentModule = ClimateMachine.SystemSolvers
```

An abstract iterative solver requires **one struct**, **one constructor**,
and **two functions** in order to interface with the rest of [ClimateMachine](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl).
In what follows we will describe in detail the function signatures,
return values, and struct properties necessary to build with
[ClimateMachine](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimateMachine.jl).

We have the following concrete implementations:
1. [`GeneralizedMinimalResidual`](@ref)
2. [`GeneralizedConjugateResidual`](@ref)
3. [`ConjugateGradient`](@ref)
4. [`BatchedGeneralizedMinimalResidual`](@ref)

## Basic Template for an Iterative Solver

A basic template of an iterative solver could be as follows:

```julia

export MyIterativeMethod

# struct
struct MyIterativeMethod{FT} <: AbstractIterativeSystemSolver
    # minimum
    rtol::FT
    atol::FT
    # Add more structure if necessary
end

# constructor
function MyIterativeMethod(args...)
    # body of constructor
    return MyIterativeMethod(contructor_args...)
end

# initialize function (1)
function initialize!(linearoperator!, Q, Qrhs, solver::MyIterativeMethod, args...)
    # body of initialize function in abstract iterative solver
    return Bool, Int
end

# iteration function (2)
function doiteration!(linearoperator!, Q, Qrhs, solver::MyIterativeMethod, threshold, args...)
    # body of iteration
    return Bool, Int, Float
end

```
MyIterativeMethod and function bodies would need to be replaced appropriately
for a particular implementation. We will describe each component in detail
in subsequent sections.

### Struct

A subset of AbstractIterativeSystemSolver needs at least two members:
atol and rtol. The former represents an absolute tolerance and the latter
is a relative tolerance. Both can be used to terminate the iteration to
determine the convergence criteria. An example struct could be

```julia
struct MyIterativeMethod{FT} <: AbstractIterativeSystemSolver
    atol::FT
    rtol::FT
end
```
but often has more depending on the kind of iterative solver
being used.  For example, in a Krylov subspace method one would
need to store a number of vectors which constitute the [Krylov
subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krylov_subspace).

### Constructor

The constructor for the struct can be defined any number of ways depending
on the needs of the struct itself. Often times this is just used to allocate
memory or convergence thresholds. This can also be a good place to define
structures that make the iterative solver easier to work with. For example,
for a columnwise solver one would want an easy array structure to work
with vectors in a columnwise fashion.

In [Basic Template for an Iterative Solver](@ref) we used an outer
constructor, e.g.,

```julia
# constructor
function MyIterativeMethod(args...)
    # body of constructor
    return MyIterativeMethod(contructor_args...)
end
```
but we could have also used an inner constructor if desired.

### Initialize Function

The initialize function needs the following signature
```julia
function initialize!(linearoperator!, Q, Qrhs, solver::MyIterativeMethod, args...)
    # body of initialize function in abstract iterative solver
    return Bool, Int
end
```


The intialize function has the following **arguments**:
1. ```linearoperator!``` (function)
1. ```Q```    (array) [OVERWRITTEN]
1. ```Qrhs``` (array)
1. ```solver``` (struct) used for dispatch
1. ```args...``` passed to ```linearoperator!``` function

The ```linearoperator!``` function is assumed to have the following signature:
```julia
linearoperator!(y, x, args...)
    # body of linear operator
    return nothing
end
```
It represents action of a linear operator ``L`` on a vector ``x``, that
stores the value in the vector ``y``, i.e. ``Lx = y``. The last argument
(the args...) is necessary due to how linear operators are defined within
ClimateMachine.

The ``` Q ``` and ```Qrhs``` function arguments are supposed to represent
the solution of the linear system `LQ = Qrhs` where `L` is the linear
operator implicitly defined by ```linearoperator!```.

The initialize function must have **2 return values**:
1. ```convergence``` (bool)
1. ```iterations``` (int)

The return values keep track of whether or not the iterative algorithm
has converged as well as how many times the linear operator was applied.

### Iteration Function

The iteration function needs the following signature

```julia
function doiteration!(linearoperator!, Q, Qrhs, solver::MyIterativeMethod, threshold, args...)
    # body of iteration
    return Bool, Int, Float
end
```

The iteration function has the following **arguments**:
1. ```linearoperator!``` (function)
1. ```Q``` (array) [OVERWRITTEN]
1. ```Qrhs``` (array)
1. ```solver``` (struct). used for dispatch
1. ```threshold``` (float). for the convergence criteria
1. ```args...``` passed into the ```linearoperator!``` function

The ```linearoperator!``` function is assumed to have the following signature:
```julia
linearoperator!(y, x, args...)
    # body of linear operator
    return nothing
end
```
It represents action of a linear operator ``L`` on a vector ``x``, that
stores the value in the vector ``y``, i.e. ``Lx = y``. The last argument
(the args...) is necessary due to how linear operators are defined within
ClimateMachine.

The ``` Q ``` and ```Qrhs``` function arguments are supposed to represent
the solution of the linear system `LQ = Qrhs` where `L` is the linear
operator implicitly defined by ```linearoperator!```.

The iteration function must have **3 return values**:
1. ```converged``` (bool)
1. ```iterations``` (int)
1. ```residual_norm``` (float64)

The return values keep track of whether or not the iterative algorithm has
converged as well as how many times the linear operator was applied. The
residual norm is useful since it is often used to determine a stopping
criteria.

## ClimateMachine Specific Considerations
An MPIStateArray ```Q``` in 3D, has the following structure by default:
```julia
size(Q) = (n_ijk, n_s, n_e)
```
where
1. ```n_ijk``` is the number of Gauss-Lobatto points per element
1. ```n_s``` is the number of states
1. ```n_e``` is the number of elements

In three dimensions, if one wants to operate in a column-wise fashion
(with a stacked-brick topology) it is easiest to reshape the array into
the following form

```julia
alias_Q = reshape(Q, (n_i, n_j, n_k, n_s, n_ev, n_eh))
```
where
1. ```n_i``` is the number of Gauss-Lobatto points per element within
element that are aligned with one of the horizontal directions.
1. ```n_j``` is the number of Gauss-Lobatto points per element within
element that are aligned with another one of the horizontal directions.
1. ```n_k``` is the number of Gauss-Lobatto points within element that
are aligned with the vertical direction.
1. ```n_s``` is the number of states
1. ```n_ev``` is the number of elements in the vertical direction
1. ```n_eh``` is the number of elements in the horizontal direction

Note: ```n_i x n_j x n_k = n_ijk``` and ```n_ev x n_eh = n_e```.

Thus if one wants to operate on a column for a fixed state index (let's say
the int ```s```) and a fixed horizontal coordinate (let's say fixed ints
```i```, ```j```, ```eh```), then one could operator on the state:

```julia
one_column = alias_Q[i, j, :, s, :, eh]
```

which are the third and fifth argument in the MPIStateArray.

Some extra tips are:
- Since GPUs have limited memory, don't take up too much memory.
- If possible define a preconditioner. Iterative methods are typically
very slow otherwise.

## Preconditioners

The code needs to be slightly restructured to allow for preconditioners.

## Writing Tests

Test on small systems where answers can be checked analytically. Check with
matrices with easily computable inverses, i.e., the identity matrix or a
diagonal matrix. Test with diverse matrix structures. Test with different
array types: Arrays, CuArrays, MPIStateArrays, etc. Also test with balance
laws to make sure that it can actually be run with IMEX solvers on the
CPU/GPU and their distributed analogues.

## Performance Checks

Timing performance can be done with general CPU/GPU guidelines

## Conventions

- Q refers to the initial guess for the iterative solver that gets
overwritten with the final solution
- Qrhs refers to the right hand side of the linear system
