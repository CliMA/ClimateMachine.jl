# ClimateMachine Variable List

This document is currently for collaborators within the project with
access to the Overleaf CliMA-Atmos docs. The purpose of this page is to
unify the naming conventions used in the Overleaf document in a manner
useful for coding. This document suggests 'reserved' variable names in
`<property>_<species>` format with the default working fluid (no-subscript)
being moist air. Contributors to the CliMA repository are welcome to
suggest changes when necessary.

## Type parameters

The Julia code typically uses `T` as a type parameter, however this
conflicts with the typical usage for temperature. Instead, good choices are:
- `FT` for floating point values

### 2.1  Working Fluid and Equation of State

P_<species>     = pressure, species (no subscript == default working fluid moist air)
ρ_<species>     = density, species (no subscript == default working fluid moist air)
R_m             = gas constant, moist
R_d             = gas constant, dry

conv_q_vap_to_q_liq      = tendency to q_liq and q_ice due to
                           condensation/evaporation and
                           sublimation/resublimation from q_vap [1/s]
