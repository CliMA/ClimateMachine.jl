# # [Multirate Infinitesimal Step (MIS) Timestepping](@id MIS-Timestepping)

# In this tutorial, we shall explore the use of Multirate Infinitesimal Step
# (MIS) methods for the solution of nonautonomous (or non time-invariant) equations.
# For our model problem, we shall reuse the rising thermal bubble
# tutorial. See its [tutorial page](@ref Rising-Thermal-Bubble-Configuration)
# for details on the model and parameters. For the purposes of this tutorial,
# we will only run the experiment for a total of 500 simulation seconds.

# Referencing the formulation introduced in the previous
# [Multirate RK methods tutorial](@ref Multirate-RK-Timestepping), we can
# describe Multirate Infinitesimal Step (MIS) methods by

# ```math
# \begin{align}
# v_i (0)
#   &= q^n + \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \alpha_{ij} (Q^{(j)} - q^n) \\
# \frac{dv_i}{d\tau}
#   &= \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \frac{\gamma_{ij}}{d_i \Delta t} (Q^{(j)} - q^n)
#     + \sum_{j=1}^i \frac{\beta_{ij}}{d_i} \mathcal{T}_S (Q^{(j)}, t + \Delta t c_i)
#     + \mathcal{T}_F(v_i, t^n +  \Delta t \tilde c_i + \frac{c_i - \tilde c_i}{d_i} \tau),
# \quad \tau \in [0, \Delta t d_i] \\
# Q^{(i)} &= v_i(\Delta t d_i),
# \end{align}
# ```
#
# where we have used the the stage values ``Q^{(i)} = v_i(\tau_i)`` as the
# solution to the _inner_ ODE problem, ``{\mathcal{T}_{s}}``
# for the slow component, and ``{\mathcal{T}_{f}}` for the fast
# one, as in the [Multirate RK methods tutorial](@ref Multirate-RK-Timestepping).

# Referencing the canonical form introduced in [Time integration](@ref
# Time-integration), both ``{\mathcal{T}_{f}}`` and ``{\mathcal{T}_{s}}``
# could be discretized either explicitly or implicitly, hence, they could
# belong to either ``\mathcal{F}(t, \boldsymbol{q})`` or ``\mathcal{G}(t, \boldsymbol{q})``
# term.
#
# The method is defined in terms of the lower-triangular matrices ``\alpha``,
# ``\beta`` and ``\gamma``, with ``d_i = \sum_j \beta_{ij}``,
# ``c_i = (I - \alpha - \gamma)^{-1} d`` and ``\tilde c = \alpha c``.
# More details can be found in [WenschKnothGalant2009](@cite) and
# [KnothWensch2014](@cite).

# The reader can compare the Courant number (denoted by `CFL` in the code snippet)
# used in this example, with the adopted in the
# [single-rate explicit timestepping tutorial page](@ref Single-rate-Explicit-Timestepping)
# in which we use the same scheme as the fast method employed in this case,
# and notice that with this MIS method we are able to take a much larger
# Courant number.
