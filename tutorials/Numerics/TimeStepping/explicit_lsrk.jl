# After discretizing the spatial terms in the equation, the semi-discretization
# of the governing equations have the form:

# ``
# \begin{aligned}
#     \frac{\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{q}}{ \mathrm{d} t} &= M^{-1}\left(M S +
#     D^{T} M (F^{adv} + F^{visc}) + \sum_{f=1}^{N_f} L^T M_f(\widehat{F}^{adv} + \widehat{F}^{visc})
#     \right) \equiv \mathcal{T}(\boldsymbol{q}).
# \end{aligned}
# ``

# Referencing the canonical form introduced in [Time integration](@ref
# Time-integration) we have that in any explicit
# formulation ``\mathcal{F}(t, \boldsymbol{q}) \equiv 0`` and, in this particular
# forumlation, ``\mathcal{T}(t, \boldsymbol{q}) \equiv \mathcal{G}(t, \boldsymbol{q})``.

# The time step restriction for an explicit method must satisfy the stable
# [Courant number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant%E2%80%93Friedrichs%E2%80%93Lewy_condition)
# for the specific time-integrator and must be selected from the following
# constraints
#
# ``
# \Delta t_{\mathrm{explicit}} = min \left( \frac{C \Delta x_i}{u_i + a}, \frac{C \Delta x_i^2}{\nu} \right)
# ``
#
# where ``C`` is the stable Courant number, ``u_i`` denotes the velocity components,
# ``a`` the speed of sound, ``\Delta x_i`` the grid spacing (non-uniform in case of
# spectral element methods) along the direction ``(x_1,x_2,x_3)``, and ``\nu`` the
# kinematic viscosity. The first term on the right is the time step condition
# due to the non-dissipative components, while the second term to the dissipation.
# For explicit time-integrators, we have to find the minimum time step that
# satisfies this condition along all three spatial directions.
#
# ## Runge-Kutta methods
#
# A single step of an ``s``-stage Runge-Kutta (RK) method for
# solving the resulting ODE problem presented above and can be
# expressed as the following:
#
# ```math
# \begin{align}
# 	\boldsymbol{q}^{n+1} = \boldsymbol{q}^n + \Delta t \sum_{i=1}^{s} b_i \mathcal{T}(\boldsymbol{Q}^i),
# \end{align}
# ```
#
# where ``\boldsymbol{\mathcal{T}}(\boldsymbol{Q}^i)`` is the evaluation of the
# right-hand side tendency at the stage value ``\boldsymbol{Q}^i``, defined at
# each stage of the RK method:
#
# ```math
# \begin{align}
# 	\boldsymbol{Q}^i = \boldsymbol{q}^{n} +
#     \Delta t \sum_{j=1}^{s} a_{i,j}
#     \mathcal{T}(\boldsymbol{Q}^j).
# \end{align}
# ```
#
# The first stage is initialized using the field at the previous time step:
# ``\boldsymbol{Q}^{1} \leftarrow \boldsymbol{q}^n``.
#
# In the above expressions, we define
# ``\boldsymbol{A} = \lbrace a_{i,j} \rbrace \in \mathbb{R}^{s\times s}``,
# ``\boldsymbol{b} = \lbrace b_i \rbrace \in \mathbb{R}^s``, and
# ``\boldsymbol{c} = \lbrace c_i \rbrace \in \mathbb{R}^s`` as the
# characteristic coefficients of a given RK method. This means we can
# associate any RK method with its so-called *Butcher tableau*:
#
# ```math
# \begin{align}
#     \begin{array}{c|c}
#         \boldsymbol{c} &\boldsymbol{A}\\
#         \hline
#         & \boldsymbol{b}^T
#         \end{array} =
#         \begin{array}{c|c c c c}
#         c_1 & a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,s}\\
#         c_2 & a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,s}\\
#         \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
#         c_s & a_{s,1} & a_{s,2} & \cdots & a_{s,s}\\
#         \hline
#         & b_1 & b_2 & \cdots & b_s
#     \end{array}.
# \end{align}
# ```
#
# The vector ``\boldsymbol{c}`` is often called the *consistency vector*,
# and is typically subjected to the row-sum condition:
#
# ``
# c_i = \sum_{j=1}^{s} a_{i,j}, \quad \forall i = 1, \cdots, s.
# ``
#
# This simplifies the order conditions for higher-order RK methods.
# For more information on general RK methods, we refer the interested reader
# to Ch. 5.2 of [Atkinson2011](@cite).

# ### [Low-storage Runge-Kutta (LSRK) methods](@id lsrk)
# `ClimateMachine.jl` contains the following low-storage methods:
#   - Forward Euler [`LowStorageRungeKutta2N`](@ref ClimateMachine.ODESolvers.LowStorageRungeKutta2N),
#   - A 5-stage 4th-order Runge-Kutta method of Carpenter and Kennedy [`LSRK54CarpenterKennedy`](@ref ClimateMachine.ODESolvers.LSRK54CarpenterKennedy)
#   - A 14-stage 4th-order Runge-Kutta method developed by Niegemann, Diehl, and Busch [`LSRK144NiegemannDiehlBusch`](@ref ClimateMachine.ODESolvers.LSRK144NiegemannDiehlBusch).
#
# To start, let's try using the 5-stage method: `LSRK54CarpenterKennedy`.

# As is the case for all explicit methods, we are limited by the fastest
# propogating waves described by our governing equations. In our case,
# these are the acoustic waves (with approximate wave speed given by the
# speed of sound of 343 m/s).
# For the rising bubble example used here, we use 4th order polynomials in
# a discontinuous Galerkin approximation, with a domain resolution of
# 125 meters in each spatial direction. This gives an effective
# minimanl nodal distance (distance between LGL nodes) of 86 meters
# over the entire mesh. Using the equation for the explcit time-step above,
# we can determine the ``\Delta t`` by specifying the desired Courant number
# ``C`` (denoted `CFL` in the code below).
# In our case, a heuristically determined value of 0.4 is used.

timeend = FT(100)
ode_solver =
    ClimateMachine.ExplicitSolverType(solver_method = LSRK54CarpenterKennedy)
CFL = FT(0.4)
run_simulation(ode_solver, CFL, timeend);

# What if we wish to take a larger timestep size?  We could
# try to increase the target Courant number, say ``C = 1.7``, and
# re-run the simulation. But this would break! In fact, in this case the numerical
# scheme would fall outside of the stability region and the simulation would crash.
# This occurs when the time step _exceeds_ the maximal stable time-step size
# of the method. For the 5-stage method, one can typically get away with using
# time-step sizes corresponding to a Courant number of ``C \approx 0.4`` but
# typically not much larger. In contrast, we can use an LSRK method with
# a larger stability region. Let's illustrate this by using the 14-stage method
# with a ``C = 1.7`` instead.

ode_solver = ClimateMachine.ExplicitSolverType(
    solver_method = LSRK144NiegemannDiehlBusch,
)
CFL = FT(1.7)
run_simulation(ode_solver, CFL, timeend);

# And it successfully completes. Currently, the 14-stage LSRK method
# `LSRK144NiegemannDiehlBusch` contains the largest stability region of the
# low-storage methods available in `ClimateMachine.jl`.

# ### [Strong Stability Preserving Runge--Kutta (SSPRK) methods](@id ssprk)

# Just as with the LSRK methods, the SSPRK methods are self-starting,
# with ``\boldsymbol{Q}^{1} = \boldsymbol{q}^n``, and stage-values are of the form

# ```math
# \begin{align}
#     \boldsymbol{Q}^{i+1} = a_{i,1} \boldsymbol{q}^n
#     + a_{i,2} \boldsymbol{Q}^{i}
#     + \Delta t b_i\mathcal{T}(\boldsymbol{Q}^{i})
# \end{align}
# ```
#
# with the value at the next step being the ``(N+1)``-th stage value
# ``\boldsymbol{q}^{n+1} = \boldsymbol{Q}^{(N+1)}``. This allows the updates
# to be performed with only three copies of the state vector
# (storing ``\boldsymbol{q}^n``, ``\boldsymbol{Q}^{i}`` and ``\mathcal{T}(\boldsymbol{Q}^{i})``).
# We illustrate here the use of a [`SSPRK33ShuOsher`](@ref ClimateMachine.ODESolvers.SSPRK33ShuOsher) method.

ode_solver = ClimateMachine.ExplicitSolverType(solver_method = SSPRK33ShuOsher)
CFL = FT(0.2)
run_simulation(ode_solver, CFL, timeend);
