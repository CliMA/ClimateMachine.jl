# # Batched Generalized Minimal Residual
# In this tutorial we describe the basics of using the batched gmres iterative solver.
# At the end you should be able to
# 1. Use BatchedGeneralizedMinimalResidual to solve batches of linear systems
# 2. Construct a columnwise linear solver with BatchedGeneralizedMinimalResidual

# ## What is the Generalized Minimal Residual Method?
# The  Generalized Minimal Residual Method (GMRES) is a [Krylov subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krylov_subspace) method for solving linear systems:
# ```math
#  Ax = b
# ```
# See the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_minimal_residual_method) for more details.

# ## What is the Batched Generalized Minimal Residual Method?
# As the name suggests it solves a whole bunch of independent GMRES problems

# ## Basic Example
# First we must load a few things
using ClimateMachine
using ClimateMachine.SystemSolvers
using LinearAlgebra, Random, Plots

# Next we define two linear systems that we would like to solve simultaneously.
# The matrix for the first linear system is
A1 = [
    2.0 -1.0 0.0
    -1.0 2.0 -1.0
    0.0 -1.0 2.0
];
# And the right hand side is
b1 = ones(typeof(1.0), 3);
# The exact solution to the first linear system is
x1_exact = [1.5, 2.0, 1.5];
# The matrix for the first linear system is
A2 = [
    2.0 -1.0 0.0
    0.0 2.0 -1.0
    0.0 0.0 2.0
];
# And the right hand side is
b2 = ones(typeof(1.0), 3);
# The exact solution to second linear system is
x2_exact = [0.875, 0.75, 0.5];

# We now define a function that performs the action of each linear operator independently.
function closure_linear_operator(A1, A2)
    function linear_operator!(x, y)
        mul!(view(x, :, 1), A1, view(y, :, 1))
        mul!(view(x, :, 2), A2, view(y, :, 2))
        return nothing
    end
    return linear_operator!
end;

# To understand how this works let us construct an instance
# of the linear operator and apply it to a vector
linear_operator! = closure_linear_operator(A1, A2);
# Let us see what the action of this linear operator is
y1 = ones(typeof(1.0), 3);
y2 = ones(typeof(1.0), 3) * 2.0;
y = [y1 y2];
x = copy(y);
linear_operator!(x, y);
x
# We see that the first column is `A1 * [1 1 1]'`
# and the second column is `A2 * [2 2 2]'`
# that is,
[A1 * y1 A2 * y2]

# We are now ready to set up our Batched Generalized Minimal Residual solver
# We must now set up the right hand side of the linear system
b = [b1 b2];
# as well as the exact solution, (to verify convergence)
x_exact = [x1_exact x2_exact];
# !!! warning
#     For BatchedGeneralizedMinimalResidual the assumption is that each column of b is independent and corresponds to a batch. This will come back later.

# We now use an instance of the solver
linearsolver = BatchedGeneralizedMinimalResidual(b);
# As well as an initial guess, denoted by the variable x
x1 = ones(typeof(1.0), 3);
x2 = ones(typeof(1.0), 3);
x = [x1 x2];
# To solve the linear system, we just need to pass to the linearsolve! function
iters = linearsolve!(linear_operator!, linearsolver, x, b)
# which is guaranteed to converge in 3 iterations since `length(b1)=length(b2)=3`
# We can now check that the solution that we computed, x
x
# has converged to the exact solution
x_exact
# Which indeed it has.
# ## Advanced Example

# We now go through a more advanced application of the Batched Generalized Minimal Residual solver
# !!! warning
#     Iterative methods should be used with preconditioners!
# The first thing we do is define a linear operator that mimics
# the behavior of a columnwise operator in ClimateMachine
function closure_linear_operator!(A, tup)
    function linear_operator!(y, x)
        alias_x = reshape(x, tup)
        alias_y = reshape(y, tup)
        for i6 in 1:tup[6]
            for i4 in 1:tup[4]
                for i2 in 1:tup[2]
                    for i1 in 1:tup[1]
                        tmp = alias_x[i1, i2, :, i4, :, i6][:]
                        tmp2 = A[i1, i2, i4, i6] * tmp
                        alias_y[i1, i2, :, i4, :, i6] .=
                            reshape(tmp2, (tup[3], tup[5]))
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
end;
# Next we define the array structure of an MPIStateArray
# in its true high dimensional form
tup = (2, 2, 5, 2, 10, 2);
# We define our linear operator as a random matrix
Random.seed!(1234);
B = [
    randn(tup[3] * tup[5], tup[3] * tup[5])
    for i1 in 1:tup[1], i2 in 1:tup[2], i4 in 1:tup[4], i6 in 1:tup[6]
];
columnwise_A = [
    B[i1, i2, i4, i6] + 3 * (i1 + i2 + i4 + i6) * I
    for i1 in 1:tup[1], i2 in 1:tup[2], i4 in 1:tup[4], i6 in 1:tup[6]
];
# as well as its inverse
columnwise_inv_A = [
    inv(columnwise_A[i1, i2, i4, i6])
    for i1 in 1:tup[1], i2 in 1:tup[2], i4 in 1:tup[4], i6 in 1:tup[6]
];
columnwise_linear_operator! = closure_linear_operator!(columnwise_A, tup);
columnwise_inverse_linear_operator! =
    closure_linear_operator!(columnwise_inv_A, tup);
# The structure of an MPIStateArray is related to its true
# higher dimensional form as follows:
mpi_tup = (tup[1] * tup[2] * tup[3], tup[4], tup[5] * tup[6]);
# We now define the right hand side of our Linear system
b = randn(mpi_tup);
# As well as the initial guess
x = copy(b);
x += randn(mpi_tup) * 0.1;
# In the previous tutorial we mentioned that it is assumed that
# the right hand side is an array whose column vectors all independent linear
# systems. But right now the array structure of ``x`` and ``b`` do not follow
# this requirement.
# To handle this case we must pass in additional arguments that tell the
# linear solver how to reconcile these differences.
# The first thing that the linear solver must know of is the higher tensor
# form of the MPIStateArray, which is just the `tup` from before
reshape_tuple_f = tup;
# The second thing it needs to know is which indices correspond to a column
# and we want to make sure that these are the first set of indices that appear
# in the permutation tuple (which can be thought of as enacting
# a Tensor Transpose).
permute_tuple_f = (5, 3, 4, 6, 1, 2);
# It has this format since the 3 and 5 index slots
# are the ones associated with traversing a column. And the 4 index
# slot corresponds to a state.
# We also need to tell our solver which kind of Array struct to use
ArrayType = Array;

# We are now ready to finally define our linear solver, which uses a number
# of keyword arguments
gmres = BatchedGeneralizedMinimalResidual(
    b,
    ArrayType = ArrayType,
    m = tup[3] * tup[5] * tup[4],
    n = tup[1] * tup[2] * tup[6],
    reshape_tuple_f = reshape_tuple_f,
    permute_tuple_f = permute_tuple_f,
    atol = eps(Float64) * 10^2,
    rtol = eps(Float64) * 10^2,
);
# `m` is the number of gridpoints along a column. As mentioned previously,
# this is `tup[3]*tup[5]*tup[4]`. The `n` term corresponds to the batch size
# or the number of columns in this case. `atol` and `rtol` are relative and
# absolute tolerances

# All the hard work is done, now we just call our linear solver
iters = linearsolve!(
    columnwise_linear_operator!,
    gmres,
    x,
    b,
    max_iters = tup[3] * tup[5] * tup[4],
)
# We see that it converged in less than `tup[3]*tup[5] = 50` iterations.
# Let us verify that it is indeed correct by computing the exact answer
# numerically and comparing it against the iterative solver.
x_exact = copy(x);
columnwise_inverse_linear_operator!(x_exact, b);
# Now we can compare with some norms
norm(x - x_exact) / norm(x_exact)
columnwise_linear_operator!(x_exact, x);
norm(x_exact - b) / norm(b)
# Which we see are small, given our choice of `atol` and `rtol`.
# The struct also keeps a record of its convergence rate
# in the residual member. The convergence rate of each column
# can be visualized via
plot(log.(gmres.residual[1:iters, :]) / log(10));
