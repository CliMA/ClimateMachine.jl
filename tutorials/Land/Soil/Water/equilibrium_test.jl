# # Hydrostatic Equilibrium test for Richards Equation

# This tutorial shows how to use `ClimateMachine` code to solve
# Richards equation in a column of soil. We choose boundary
# conditions of zero flux at the top and bottom of the column,
# and then run the simulation long enough to see that the system
# is approaching hydrostatic equilibrium, where the gradient of the
# pressure head is equal and opposite the gradient of the
# gravitational head. Note that the [`SoilWaterModel`](@ref
# ClimateMachine.Land.SoilWaterModel) includes
# a prognostic equation for the volumetric ice fraction,
# as ice is a form of water that must be accounted for to1 ensure
# water mass conservation. If freezing and thawing are not turned on
# (the default), the amount of ice in the model is zero for all space and time
# (again by default). 

# The equations are:

# ``
# \frac{ ∂ ϑ_l}{∂ t} = ∇ ⋅ K (T, ϑ_l, θ_i; ν, ...) ∇h( ϑ_l, z; ν, ...).
# ``

# ``
# \frac{ ∂ θ_i}{∂ t} = 0
# ``

# Here

# ``t`` is the time (s),

# ``z`` is the location in the vertical (m),

# ``T`` is the temperature of the soil (K),

# ``K`` is the hydraulic conductivity (m/s),

# ``h`` is the hydraulic head (m),

# ``ϑ_l`` is the augmented volumetric liquid water fraction,

# ``θ_i`` is the volumetric ice fraction, and

# ``ν, ...`` denotes parameters relating to soil type, such as porosity.


# We will solve this equation in an effectively 1-d domain with ``z ∈ [-10,0]``,
# and with the following boundary and initial conditions:

# ``- K ∇h(t, z = 0) = 0 ẑ ``

# `` -K ∇h(t, z = -10) = 0 ẑ``

# `` ϑ(t = 0, z) = ν-0.001 ``

# `` θ_i(t = 0, z) = 0.0. ``

# where ``\nu`` is the porosity.

# A word about the hydraulic conductivity: please see the
# [`hydraulic functions`](./hydraulic_functions.md) tutorial
# for options regarding this function. The user can choose to make it depend
# on the temperature and the amount of ice in the soil; the default, which we use
# here, is that `K` only depends on the liquid moisture content.

# Lastly, our formulation of this equation allows for a continuous solution in both
# saturated and unsaturated areas, following [Woodward00a](@cite).

# [`PrescribedTemperatureModel`](@ref

# depending on time and space; if this option is desired, one could also
# choose to model the temperature dependence of viscosity, or to drive
# a freeze/thaw cycle, for example. If the user simply wants to model
# Richards equation for liquid water, the defaults will allow for that.
# Here we ignore the effects of temperature and freezing and thawing,

# potential to the pressure generated by compression of water and the soil
# matrix. The profile can be solved
# for analytically by (1) solving for the form that `ϑ_l(z)` must take
# in both the saturated and unsaturated zones to satisfy the steady-state
# requirement with zero flux boundary conditions, (2) requiring that
# at the interface between saturated and unsaturated zones, the water content
# equals porosity, and (3) solving for the location of the interface by
# requiring that the integrated water content at the end matches that
# at the beginning (yielding an interface location of `z≈-0.56m`).
