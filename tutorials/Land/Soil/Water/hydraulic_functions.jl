# # Hydraulic functions

# This tutorial shows how to specify the hydraulic functions
# used in Richard's equation. In particular,
# we show how to choose the formalism for matric potential and hydraulic
# conductivity, and how to make the hydraulic conductivity account for
# the presence of ice as well as the temperature dependence of the
# viscosity of liquid water.


# ClimateMachine's Land model allows the user to pick between two hydraulics models,
# that of van Genuchten [1] or that of Brooks and Corey [2, 3]. The
# same model is consistently used for the matric potential
# and hydraulic conductivity.

# # Specifying a  `hydraulics` model
# The van Genuchten model requires two free parameters, `α` and `n`.
# A third parameter, `m`, is computed from `n`. Of these, only `α` carries
# units, of inverse meters. The Brooks and Corey model also uses
# two free parameters, `ψ_b`, the magnitude of the matric potential at saturation,
#  and a constant `M`. `ψ_b` carries units of meters. The hydraulic conductivity
# requires an additional parameter, `Ksat` (m/s), which is the hydraulic conductivity
# in saturated soil. This parameter is the same between the two models for a given
# soil type, and is not stored in the `hydraulics` model, but rather as part of the
# [`SoilParamFunctions`](@ref ClimateMachine.Land.SoilParamFunctions).

# Below we show how to create two concrete examples of these hydraulics models,
# for sandy loam [1]. Note that the parameters chosen are a function of soil type.
vg_α = FT(7.5) # m^-1
vg_n = FT(1.89)
hydraulics = vanGenuchten{FT}(α = vg_α, n = vg_n)

ψ_sat = 0.09 # m
Mval = 0.228
hydraulics_bc = BrooksCorey{FT}(ψb = ψ_sat, m = Mval);
# # Matric Potential
# The matric potential `ψ` represents how much water clings to soil. Drier soil
# holds onto water more tightly, making diffusion more difficult. As soil becomes
# wetter, the matric potential decreases in magnitude, making diffusion easier.

# The van Genuchten expression for matric potential is
# ``
# ψ = -\frac{1}{α} S_l^{-1/(nm)}\times (1-S_l^{1/m})^{1/n},
# ``

# and the Brooks and Corey expression is
# ``
# ψ = -ψ_b S_l^{-M}.
# ``

# Here `S_l` is the effective saturation of liquid water, `θ_l/ν`, where `ν` is
# porosity of the soil. We neglect the residual pore space in the CliMA model.

# In the CliMA code, we use [multiple dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch).
# With multiple dispatch, a function can have many
# ways of executing (called methods), depending on the *type* of the
# variables passed in. A simple example of multiple dispatch is the division operation.
# Integer division takes two numbers as input, and returns an integer - ignoring the decimal.
# Float division takes two numbers as input, and returns a floating point number, including the decimal.
# In Julia, we might write these as:

#     function division(a::Int, b::Int)
#          return floor(Int, a/b)
#     end
#
#     function division(a::Float64, b::Float64)
#          return a/b
#     end


# We can see that `division` is now a function with two methods.

#     julia> division
#     division (generic function with 2 methods)

# Now, using the same function signature, we can carry out integer
# division or floating point division, depending on the types of the
# arguments:

#     julia> division(1,2)
#     0
#
#     julia> division(1.0,2.0)
#     0.5


# Here is a more pertinent example:
# `hydraulics` is of type `vanGenuchten{Float32}` based on our choice of `FT`:

#     julia> typeof(hydraulics)
#     vanGenuchten{Float32}


# but meanwhile,

#     julia> typeof(hydraulics_bc)
#     BrooksCorey{Float32}


# The function `matric_potential` will execute different methods
# depending on if we pass a hydraulics model of type `vanGenuchten` or
# `BrooksCorey`. In both cases, it will return the correct value
# for `ψ`.

# Let's plot the matric potential as a function of the effective saturation `S_l = θ_l/ν`,
# which can range from zero to one. 
S_l = FT.(0.01:0.01:0.99)
ψ = matric_potential.(Ref(hydraulics), S_l)
ψ_bc = matric_potential.(Ref(hydraulics_bc), S_l)

)
plot!(S_l, log10.(-ψ_bc), label = "Brooks and Corey")

# ![](bc_vg_matric_potential.png)

# The steep slope in
# `ψ` near saturated and completely dry soil are part of the reason
# why Richard's equation is such a challenging numerical problem.


# # Hydraulic conductivity
# The hydraulic conductivity is a more complex function than the matric potential,
# as it depends on the temperature of the water, the volumetric ice fraction, and
# the volumetric liquid water fraction. It also depends on the `hydraulics` model
# chosen.

# We represent the hydraulic conductivity `K` as the product of four factors:
# `Ksat`, an `impedance_factor` (which accounts for the effect of ice on conductivity)
# a `viscosity_factor` (which accounts for the effect of temperature on the
# viscosity of liquid water, and how that in turn affects conductivity)
# and a `moisture_factor` (which accounts for the effect of liquid water, and is determined by the `hydraulics` model).

#  Let's start with ice and temperature independence, but moisture dependence.
# Below
# we choose additional parameters, consistent with the `hydraulics` parameters
# for sandy loam [1].
ν = FT(0.41)
Ksat = FT(4.42 / (3600 * 100))
moisture_choice = MoistureDependent{FT}()
viscosity_choice = ConstantViscosity{FT}()
impedance_choice = NoImpedance{FT}();

# We are going to calculate `K = Ksat × viscosity_factor × impedance_factor × moisture_factor`.
# In the code, each of these factors is a function with multiple methods, except for `Ksat`.
#  Our function `hydraulic_conductivity` calls each of these functions in turn,
# and these functions use multiple dispatch to provide the correct value for `K`.

# Like we defined new type
# classes for `vanGenuchten{FT}` and `BrooksCorey{FT}`, we also created new type classes
# for the impedance choice, the viscosity choice, and the moisture choice. 
#  For example, the function
# called `viscosity_factor`, when passed an object of type `ConstantViscosity{FT}`, executes a method that always
# returns 1. The same is true for the function `impedance_factor`, using the type
# `NoImpedance{FT}`, and for `moisture_factor`, using the type `MoistureIndependent{FT}`.

# In the case where the `moisture_factor = MoistureDependent{FT}()`, either the van
# Genuchten or Brooks and Corey expression is used based on the type of `hydraulics` model
# passed.

# The `moisture_factor` for the van Genuchten model is (denoting it as ``K_m``)

# ``
#  K_m = \sqrt{S_l}[1-(1-S_l^{1/m})^m]^2,
# ``

# for ``S_l < 1``,

# and for the Brooks and Corey model it is

# ``
# K_m = S_l^{2M+3},
# ``

# also for ``S_l<1``. When ``S_l\geq 1``, ``K_m = 1`` for each model.

# One side effect of this flexibility is that `hydraulic_conductivity`
# requires all the arguments it could possibly need passed to it, which is
# why here we must supply a value `T` and `θ_i`, even though they are not used
# in this particular example.

# and ice on the hydraulic conductivity.
# In the cases where a `TemperatureDependentViscosity{FT}` or
# `IceImpedance{FT}` type is passed, the correct factors are calculated,
# based on the temperature `T` and volumetric ice fraction `θ_i`.
# In these cases, the `viscosity_factor`, denoted here as ``K_v``,

# ``
# K_v = e^{\gamma(T-T_{ref})},

# and the `impedance_factor`, denoted ``K_i``, evaluates as:

# ``
# K_i = 10^{-\Omega f_i}

# where ``\Omega = 7`` is an empirical factor and

# ice fraction to total volumetric water fraction [5].
