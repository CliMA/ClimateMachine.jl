# # Solving the heat equation in soil

# This tutorial shows how to use CliMA code to solve the heat
# equation in soil. 
# For background on the heat equation in general,
# and how to solve it using CliMA code, please see the 
# [`heat_equation.jl`](../../Heat/heat_equation.md)
# tutorial.

# The version of the heat equation we are solving here assumes no
# sources or sinks and no diffusion of liquid water. It takes the form

# ``
# \frac{∂ ρe_{int}}{∂ t} =  ∇ ⋅ κ(θ_l, θ_i; ν, ...) ∇T
# ``

# Here

# ``t`` is the time (s),

# ``z`` is the location in the vertical (m),

# ``ρe_{int}`` is the volumetric internal energy of the soil (J/m^3),

# ``T`` is the temperature of the soil (K),

# ``κ`` is the thermal conductivity (W/m/K),

# ``ϑ_l`` is the augmented volumetric liquid water fraction,

# ``θ_i`` is the volumetric ice fraction, and

# ``ν, ...`` denotes parameters relating to soil type, such as porosity.


# We will solve this equation in an effectively 1-d domain with ``z ∈ [-1,0]``,
# and with the following boundary and initial conditions:

# ``T(t=0, z) = 277.15^\circ K``

# ``T(t, z = 0) = 288.15^\circ K ``

# `` -κ ∇T(t, z = -1) = 0 ẑ``


# The temperature ``T`` and
# volumetric internal energy ``ρe_{int}`` are related as

# ``
# ρe_{int} = ρc_s (θ_l, θ_i; ν, ...) (T - T_0) - θ_i ρ_i LH_{f0}
# ``

# where

# ``ρc_s`` is the volumetric heat capacity of the soil (J/m^3/K),

# ``T_0`` is the freezing temperature of water,

# ``ρ_i`` is the density of ice (kg/m^3), and

# ``LH_{f0}`` is the latent heat of fusion at ``T_0``.

# In this tutorial, we will use a [`PrescribedWaterModel`](@ref
# ClimateMachine.Land.PrescribedWaterModel). This option allows
# the user to specify a function for the spatial and temporal
# behavior of `θ_i` and `θ_l`; it does not solve Richard's equation
# for the evolution of moisture. Please see the tutorials
# in the `Soil/Coupled/` folder or the `Soil/Water/`
# folder for information on solving
# Richard's equation, either coupled or uncoupled from the heat equation, respectively.

# This tutorial additionally compares the output of a ClimateMachine simulation with that
# of Supplemental Program 2, Chapter 5, of Bonan (2019) [1].

# allows us compare results from our code against a published version.


# The simulation code of [1] employs a formalism for the thermal
# conductivity `κ` based on Johansen, 1975, [2]. It assumes
# no organic matter, and only requires the volumetric
# fraction of soil solids for quartz and other minerals.
# ClimateMachine employs the formalism of Balland and Arp (2005)[3],
# which requires the
# fraction of soil solids for quartz, gravel,
# organic matter, and other minerals. Dai (2019)[4] found
# model [3] to better match
# measured soil properties across a range of soil types.

# To compare the output of the two simulations, we set the organic
# matter content and gravel content to zero in the CliMA model.
# The remaining soil components (quartz and other minerals) match between
# the two. We also run the simulation for relatively wet soil
# (water content at 80% of porosity). Under these conditions,
# the two formulations for `κ`, though taking different functional forms,
# are relatively consistent.
# The differences between models are important
# for soil with organic material and for soil that is relatively dry.

# temperature is held fixed at a value larger than

# we would see that the bottom of the domain would also
# increase in temperature because there is no heat
# leaving the bottom (due to zero heat flux specified in
