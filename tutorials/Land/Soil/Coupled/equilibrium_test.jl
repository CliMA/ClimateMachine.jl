# # Coupled heat and water equations tending towards equilibrium

# Other tutorials, such as the [soil heat tutorial](../Heat/bonan_heat_tutorial.md)
# and [Richards equation tutorial](../Water/equilibrium_test.md)
# demonstrate how to solve the heat
# equation or Richard's equation without considering
# dynamic interactions between the two. As an example, the user could
# prescribe a fixed function of space and time for the liquid water content,
# and use that to drive the heat equation, but without allowing the water
# content to dynamically evolve according to Richard's equation and without
# allowing the changing temperature of the soil to affect the water
# evolution.

# Here we show how to solve the interacting heat and water equations,
# in sand, but without phase changes. This allows us to capture
# behavior that is not present in the decoupled equations.

# The equations
# are:

# ``
# \frac{∂ ρe_{int}}{∂ t} =  ∇ ⋅ κ(θ_l, θ_i; ν, ...) ∇T + ∇ ⋅ ρe_{int_{liq}} K (T,θ_l, θ_i; ν, ...) \nabla h( ϑ_l, z; ν, ...)
# ``

# ``
# \frac{ ∂ ϑ_l}{∂ t} = ∇ ⋅ K (T,θ_l, θ_i; ν, ...) ∇h( ϑ_l, z; ν, ...).
# ``

# Here

# ``t`` is the time (s),

# ``z`` is the location in the vertical (m),

# ``ρe_{int}`` is the volumetric internal energy of the soil (J/m^3),

# ``T`` is the temperature of the soil (K),

# ``κ`` is the thermal conductivity (W/m/K),

# ``ρe_{int_{liq}}`` is the volumetric internal energy of liquid water (J/m^3),

# ``K`` is the hydraulic conductivity (m/s),

# ``h`` is the hydraulic head (m),

# ``ϑ_l`` is the augmented volumetric liquid water fraction,

# ``θ_i`` is the volumetric ice fraction, and

# ``ν, ...`` denotes parameters relating to soil type, such as porosity.


# We will solve this equation in an effectively 1-d domain with ``z ∈ [-1,0]``,
# and with the following boundary and initial conditions:

# ``- κ ∇T(t, z = 0) = 0 ẑ``

# `` -κ ∇T(t, z = -1) = 0 ẑ ``

# `` T(t = 0, z) = T_{min} + (T_{max}-T_{min}) e^{Cz}``

# ``- K ∇h(t, z = 0) = 0 ẑ ``

# `` -K ∇h(t, z = -1) = 0 ẑ``

# `` ϑ(t = 0, z) = ϑ_{min} + (ϑ_{max}-ϑ_{min}) e^{Cz}, ``

# where ``C, T_{min}, T_{max}, ϑ_{min},`` and ``ϑ_{max}`` are
# constants.


# If we evolve this system for times long compared to the dynamical timescales
# of the system, we expect it to reach an equilibrium where
# the LHS of these equations tends to zero.
# Assuming zero fluxes at the boundaries, the resulting equilibrium state
# should satisfy ``∂h/∂z = 0`` and ``∂T/∂z = 0``. Physically, this means that
# the water settles into a vertical profile in which
# the resulting pressure balances gravity and that the temperature
# is constant across the domain.

#  We verify that the system is approaching this equilibrium, and we also sketch out
# an analytic calculation for the final temperature in equilibrium.

# # Analytic Expectations

# We can determine a priori what we expect the final temperature to be in
# equilibrium.

# Regardless of the final water profile in equilibrium, we know that
# the final temperature `T_f` will be a constant across the domain. All
# water that began with a temperature above this point will cool to `T_f`,
# and water that began with a temperature below this point will warm to
# `T_f`. The initial function `T(z)` is equal to `T_f` at a value of
# `z = z̃`. This is the location in space which divides these two groups
# (water that warms over time and water that cools over time) spatially.
# We can solve for `z̃(T_f)` using `T_f = T(z̃)`.

# Next, we can determine the change in energy required to cool
# the water above `z̃` to `T_f`: it is the integral from `z̃` to the surface
# at `z = 0` of ` c θ(z) T(z) `, where `c` is the volumetric heat capacity -
# a constant here - and `θ(z)` is the initial water profile. Compute the energy
# required to warm the water below `z̃` to `T_f` in a similar way, set equal, and solve
# for `T_f`. This results in `T_f = 288.056`, which is very close to the mean `T` we observe
# after 3 days, of `288.054`.

# One could also solve the equation for `ϑ_l` specified by
# ``∂ h/∂ z = 0`` to determine the functional form of the
# equilibrium profile of the liquid water.
