# # Heat equation tutorial

# In this tutorial, we'll be solving the [heat
# equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation):

# ``
# \frac{∂ ρcT}{∂ t} + ∇ ⋅ (-α ∇ρcT) = 0
# ``

# where
#  - `t` is time
#  - `α` is the thermal diffusivity
#  - `T` is the temperature
#  - `ρ` is the density
#  - `c` is the heat capacity
#  - `ρcT` is the thermal energy

# To put this in the form of ClimateMachine's [`BalanceLaw`](@ref
# ClimateMachine.BalanceLaws.BalanceLaw), we'll re-write the equation as:

# ``
# \frac{∂ ρcT}{∂ t} + ∇ ⋅ (F(α, ρcT, t)) = 0
# ``

# where
#  - ``F(α, ρcT, t) = -α ∇ρcT`` is the second-order flux

# with boundary conditions
#  - Fixed temperature ``T_{surface}`` at ``z_{min}`` (non-zero Dirichlet)
#  - No thermal flux at ``z_{min}`` (zero Neumann)

# Solving these equations is broken down into the following steps:
# 1) Preliminary configuration
# 2) PDEs
# 3) Space discretization
# 4) Time discretization / solver
# 5) Solver hooks / callbacks
# 6) Solve
# 7) Post-processing

# # Preliminary configuration

# [Fourier number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_number)
# (i.e., diffusive Courant number) is defined. Because
# the `HeatModel` is a custom model, we must define how both are computed.
# First, we must define our own implementation of `DGMethods.calculate_dt`,
# (which we imported):

# Note that, we can use a much larger Fourier number
# for implicit solvers as compared to explicit solvers.

# # Post-processing

# Our solution is stored in the array of dictionaries `all_data` whose keys are
