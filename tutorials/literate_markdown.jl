# # How to generate a literate tutorial file

# To create an tutorial using CLIMA, please use [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl), and consult the [Literate documentation](https://fredrikekre.github.io/Literate.jl/stable/) for questions.
#
# For now, all literate tutorials are held in the `tutorials` directory

# With Literate, all comments turn into markdown text and any Julia code is read and run *as if it is in the Julia REPL*.
# As a small caveat to this, you might need to suppress the output of certain commands.
# For example, if you define and run the following function

function f()
    return x = [i * i for i in 1:10]
end

x = f()

# The entire list will be output, while

f();

# does not (because of the `;`).
#
# To show plots, you may do something like the following:
using Plots
plot(x)

# Please consider writing the comments in your tutorial as if they are meant to be read as an *article explaining the topic the tutorial is meant to explain.*
# If there are any specific nuances to writing Literate documentation for CLIMA, please let us know!
