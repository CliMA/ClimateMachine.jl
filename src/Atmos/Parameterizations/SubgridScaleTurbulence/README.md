# README: SubgridScaleTurbulence.jl
This module defines functions that allow users to compute eddy viscosity and diffusivity parameters
for turbulent stresses and diffusion terms at the subgrid scale for large eddy simulations(i.e. unresolved based
on the grid resolutions)
1) The Standard Smagorinsky-Lilly model is the basic set of equations

#TODO 
2) Anisotropic minimum dissipation (Rozema et al. 2015) 
3) Dynamic-SGS (Residual based) (Marras et al. 2015)
