    SplitExplicitSolver(slow_solver, fast_solver; dt, t0 = 0, coupled = true)

This is a time stepping object for explicitly time stepping the differential
equation given by the right-hand-side function `f` with the state `Q`, i.e.,

```math
  \\dot{Q_fast} = f_fast(Q_fast, Q_slow, t)
  \\dot{Q_slow} = f_slow(Q_slow, Q_fast, t)
```

with the required time step size `dt` and optional initial time `t0`.  This
time stepping object is intended to be passed to the `solve!` command.

This method performs an operator splitting to timestep the vertical average
of the model at a faster rate than the full model. This results in a first-
order time stepper.
