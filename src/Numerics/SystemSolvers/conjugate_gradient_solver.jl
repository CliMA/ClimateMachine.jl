# Description
- Outer constructor for the ConjugateGradient struct

# Arguments
- `Q`:(array). The kind of object that linearoperator! acts on.

# Keyword Arguments
- `rtol`: (float). relative tolerance
- `atol`: (float). absolute tolerance
- `dims`: (tuple or : ). the dimensions to reduce over
- `reshape_tuple`: (tuple). the dimensions that the conjugate gradient solver operators over

# Comment
- The reshape tuple is necessary in case the linearoperator! is defined over vectors of a different size as compared to what plays nicely with the dimension reduction in the ConjugateGradient. It also allows the user to define preconditioners over arrays that are more convenienently shaped.

# Return
