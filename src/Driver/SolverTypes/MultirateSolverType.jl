# Description
    MultirateSolverType(;
        splitting_type = SlowFastSplitting(),
        fast_model = AtmosAcousticGravityLinearModel,
        implicit_solver = ManyColumnLU,

        fast_method = LSRK54CarpenterKennedy,
        timestep_ratio = 100,
    )

This solver type constructs an ODE solver using a standard multirate
Runge-Kutta implementation. This solver computes solutions to ODEs with
the partitioned form:

```math
    \\dot{Q} = f_fast(Q, t) + f_slow(Q, t)
```

where the right-hand-side functions `f_fast` and `f_slow` denote
fast and slow dynamics respectively, depending on the state `Q`.

# Arguments
- `splitting_type` (DiscreteSplittingType): The type of discrete
    splitting to apply to the right-hand side.
    Default: `SlowFastSplitting()`
- `fast_model` (Type): The model describing fast dynamics.
    Default: `AtmosAcousticGravityLinearModel`
- `implicit_solver` (Type): An implicit solver for inverting the
    implicit system of equations (if using `HEVISplitting()`).
    Default: `ManyColumnLU`
- `implicit_solver_adjustable` (Bool): A flag identifying whether
    or not the `implicit_solver` can be updated as the time-step
    size changes. This is particularly important when using
    an implicit solver within a multirate scheme.
    Default: `false`
- `slow_method` (Function): Function defining the particular explicit
    Runge-Kutta method to be used for the slow processes.
    Default: `LSRK54CarpenterKennedy`
- `fast_method` (Function): Function defining the fast solver.
    Depending on the choice of `splitting_type`, this can be
    an explicit Runge Kutta method or a 1-D IMEX (additive Runge-Kutta)
    method.
    Default: `LSRK54CarpenterKennedy`
- `timestep_ratio` (Int): Integer denoting the ratio between the slow
    and fast time-step sizes.
    Default: `100`

    )

Creates an ODE solver for the partition slow-fast ODE
using a multirate method with HEVI time-integration.
The splitting of the fast (acoustic and gravity waves)
dynamics is performed by splitting the fast model
into horizontal and vertical directions. All horizontal
acoustic waves are treated explicitly, while the 1-D
vertical problem is treated implicitly. The HEVI-splitting
of the acoustic waves is handled using an IMEX additive
Runge-Kutta method in the fast (inner-most) solver.

Examples of similar multirate-HEVI approaches include
the following references.

Currently, the only HEVI-type splitting ClimateMachine can currently
do only involves splitting the acoustic processes; it is not currently
