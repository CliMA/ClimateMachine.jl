This document lists significant changes only (minor commits such as spelling / naming are not listed here)
    1) src/VanillaAtmosDiscretizations.jl               : Include total-energy form of equations, with moisture variable q_t. Saturation adjustment version not included at this stage
    2) src/VanillaAtmosDiscretizations_kernels.jl       : Include total-energy form of equations, with moisture variable q_t. Saturation adjustment version not included at this stage
    3) src/VanillaAtmosDiscretizations_cuda.jl          : Include total-energy form of equations, with moisture variable q_t. Saturation adjustment version not included at this stage
    4) drivers/squall_line.jl                           : read GC1991 sounding, interpolate to LGL points in z direction, pass interpolated array to driver function, return tuple of prognostic variables (ρ, U, V, W, E)
    5) drivers/kurowski_bubble.jl                       : read GC1991 sounding, interpolate to LGL points in z direction, pass interpolated array to driver function, return tuple of prognostic variables (ρ, U, V, W, E)
    6) drivers/straka_density_current.jl                : Created new driver for Straka's falling bubble density current test case. 
    7) .../Utilities/src/MoistThermodynamics.jl         : Include speed of sound calculation (c = sqrt(γ R T)) with R and T obtained from the appropriate moist calculations based on q_t, q_l, q_i
